# NEWSIFY
● Newsify is a project I created using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. It utilizes the NEWS API to fetch news articles on
any topic. Made me familiar with API functioning along with JS.
● The website features a SEARCH BAR FUNCTIONALITY that allows users to find news articles based on their interests.
It has an intuitive interface and personalized news browsing experience.
